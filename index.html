              <h3>The Early Life of Subhas Chandra Bose:</h3>
                <p>Subhas Chandra Bose was rightly known as the man with an iron personality.

                  Subhas was a boy of extraordinary intelligence and immense self-respect.
                 Born in British colonized India, Subhas Bose dreamt of an independent India right from his childhood.

                <h3>Political Activities with Congress:</h3>
              <p> A ‘swadeshi’ by heart, Subhas Chandra Bose joined the Indian National Congress in 1939 
                    and left in 1940 after he had a verbal dispute with the leaders of the party.
                     According to Subhas, freedom cannot be earned only through non-violent attempts, but it requires bloodshed, too.

                <h3>Formation of INA:</h3>
               <p> Subhas Chandra Bose managed to escape from his residence in 1940, where he was kept on house arrest by the then British rulers.
                     Bose, the epitome of intelligence and a fearless fighter managed to trail across the globe, meeting influential leaders from
                      Germany, Italy, and Japan and ultimately formed the INA (Indian National Army) in 1941.
                     Netaji Subhas Chandra was a real spirited Indian who chanted the legendary words, <quote>“Give me blood, and I will give you freedom.”</quote>

                <h3>Tragic End:</h3>
                <p>Even the daring Subhas Chandra Bose couldn’t change his destiny as on 18th August 1945; 
                   he faced his tragic end when his aircraft crashed while he was heading towards Japan.
                   However, many critics won’t accept these theories floated by various government agencies,
                   and a great number of people believe that he had miraculously escaped in the air crash 
                   and lived like a hermit for some time in northern part of India.
                   The mystery surrounding his last pace of life is a hot subject still in India.
